# youtube-mpst

Application for comparing original YouTube playlists with current ones to identify songs that were deleted, blocked or made private. This application is only able to find missing songs/videos if an original registry of the playlist is available for comparison. Use this application to download registries, and LATER compare them when songs go missing.
